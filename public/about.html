<h1>About Me</h1>

<p>At this moment I want tp forget about my education, career, master and Phd and    
  I will start a new path.  The modern world is pushing people toward getting more    
  electronic technology skills. </p>

<p>Nowadays almost everything has something to do with electronic technology, and   
  the science is practically in a hurry; consequently, I am already late, but as 
  we say, "better now than ever." </p>
 
<p>In the past I programmed in some languages and worked with specific software, 
  then I moved to different areas where I almost had no opportunity to interact 
  with this kind of material; finally, I returned and the world is simply different, 
  nothing compared with my experiences.  It seems like I am arriving to another 
  world, universe or era. I am using whatever is applicable and learning new rules, 
  if I need to. By the way, this situation is the same for thousands of workers 
  around the world, unfortunately not all of them can change their life. </p>

<p>To end this story, I expect to be as succesful as I have been in the past, with 
  that in mind I will start.
  My resume is empty, my history is not relevant to this new field; I promise you   
  a good one in the future. </p>
